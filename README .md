# RSVP Movies Data Analysis & recommendations

RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company known for producing numerous super-hit movies. They have primarily focused on releasing movies for the Indian audience. However, they are now planning to venture into the global market and release a movie targeted at the global audience in 2023.

To ensure a successful entry into the global market, RSVP Movies wants to adopt a data-driven approach and analyze their past movie releases. By examining the dataset of movies released in the past three years, they aim to gain insights that can inform their decision-making process and increase the chances of success for their upcoming project.

As a data analyst and SQL expert, I have been approached by RSVP Movies to assist them with this analysis. The goal is to leverage SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset and provide recommendations based on the findings. The analysis will be divided into four segments, each focusing on different aspects of the data:

Segment 1: Movie Performance Analysis
Objective: Analyze the performance of movies released by RSVP Movies in terms of box office collections.

Segment 2: Genre Analysis
Objective: Understand the distribution of movie genres and identify the most popular genres.

Segment 3: Release Date Analysis
Objective: Analyze the release pattern of movies and identify the most successful months for movie releases.

Segment 4: Movie Duration Analysis
Objective: Analyze the movie durations and their impact on box office collections.

By conducting a thorough analysis in each of these segments, RSVP Movies aims to gain insights into the box office performance, genre preferences, release date patterns, and movie durations that resonate with the global audience. These insights will be valuable in making informed decisions, including selecting genres, scheduling release dates, and determining optimal movie durations for their upcoming project.

The analysis will involve writing SQL queries to extract relevant data, performing calculations and aggregations, and generating reports that summarize the findings. The recommendations derived from this analysis will help RSVP Movies plan their new project strategically and maximize its potential for success in the global market.

At the end of the analysis, the SQL script containing the queries and results will be submitted to RSVP Movies for their reference and implementation.
